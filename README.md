# Lab Website

As of right now, this website is written in PHP and there is no CMS. That could change, but it somewhat hampered by CMU's servers running very old versions of PHP.

To get it to run locally on your computer I highly suggest using a program such as XAMPP. You can make XAMPP treat the www folder as its home folder [quite easily](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8847392/how-to-change-xampp-localhost-to-another-folder-outside-xampp-folder).
To have the changes reflected on the real website, let nico (nzevallo@andrew.cmu.edu) know and he will pull your changes on the server.
