			<h3>Medical <b>Applications</b></h3>
				
			<p>Progression of medical technology has brought dramatic 
			improvements in surgical outcomes and prognosis. Recently,
			minimally invasive surgery has been emphasized for reducing 
			large invasiveness of traditional surgical techniques. In 
			particular, robotic-assisted surgery is playing an important 
			role in minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive robotic
			surgery has been applied in the cardiothoracic, abdominal,
			urologic, and gynecologic fields.</p>
			
			<p>We have developed a novel articulated robotic medical probe 
			that is suitable for many minimally invasive epicardial 
			interventions. </p>
