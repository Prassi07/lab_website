			<h3>Power Plant & Industrial Inspection <b>Applications</b></h3>
				
			<p>Current power plant and industrial inspection tools are
			limited in their ability to access difficult-to-reach
			locations. Some systems like inspection crawlers can easily
			drive towards a destination, but cannot fit through small
			openings or navigate tight turns. Other systems like
			borescopes are flexible and can fit through small
			cross-sectional access points, but are limited in their
			ability to push through turns or up vertical sections of
			piping. Snake robots combine the best of both types of tools:
			a small cross-section, flexibility to navigate bends, and the 
			ability to locomote and even climb vertically. This enables
			the snake robots to reach locations that are otherwise
			inaccessible.  The robots are ideal for performing remote visual 
			inspection (RVI) or carrying a sensor payload to conduct 
			nondestructive evaluations (NDE).</p>
			
			<p>	Snake robots' capabilities can be applied to performing 
			inspections in turbines, in piping systems, or in other power
			generation equipment such as Heat Recovery Steam
			Generators (HRSGs).  By reaching these locations and performing an
			inspection during planned maintenance periods, problems can be found
			and addressed to avoid unplanned downtime.</p>

			<p><b>Small & Flexible Like a Borescope</b><br \>
			The robot's flexible body can navigate around extremely tight bends, and the small cross-section allows it to fit inside small piping and through small openings.</p>
			
			<p><b>Locomotes Like a Crawler</b><br \>
			Unlike borescopes, which must be pushed like a noodle through equipment or pipes, the robots can propel themselves through piping (with bends and verticals), through equipment, and inside of tanks or open areas.</p>	
			
			<p><b>HRSGs, Turbines, Piping Systems, and More</b><br \>
			The robot's capabilities are especially useful when inspection Heat Recovery Steam Generators (outside of headers or inside of headers/tubes), inside turbines, or inside of piping or tubing.  The robot can be useful in any application that a borescope can't reach or a crawler can't fit.  The robot can perform visual inspections or could accomodate an NDE (Non-Destructive Evaluation) sensor payload.</p>
