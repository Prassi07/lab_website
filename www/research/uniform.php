			<p>Robotic spray 
			painting of car bodies motivates our work in constrained controlled coverage. 
			Painting requires that the spray gun deposit paint at each point on the 
			target surface such that the variation of the resultant paint deposition 
			is within acceptable limits; we term this the uniform coverage problem. 
			To generate a spray gun trajectory termed a coverage trajectory that uniformly 
			covers (i.e., deposits paint on) the target surface, the path planning 
			algorithm must determine the orientation of the passes in the path, the 
			spacing between them and the speed along the passes. If the distribution 
			of material coming out of the applicator has a complex form, automating 
			the process of generating coverage trajectories for uniform coverage is 
			a challenging task even on the simplest of target surfaces such as a planar 
			sheet. When the target surface is a non-Euclidean surface embedded in 
			R^3, the interaction of the complex deposition pattern with the surface 
			geometry makes the goal of achieving uniform coverage even more challenging. 
			Moreover, the dimensionality of the variables required to specify the 
			orientation of the passes, the spacing between them termed the index width, 
			and the end effector speed along the passes is huge. Therefore, global 
			optimization procedures that attempt to determine all coverage variables 
			simultaneously are computationally expensive and often not practical. 
			Our approach makes the optimization of coverage variables tractable by 
			decomposing the coverage problem into relatively independent subproblems 
			using concepts from differential geometry and standard optimization techniques.</p>

			<p>Our approach 
			decomposes the uniform coverage problem into four sub-problems : 1) <b>Cellular 
			decomposition</b>: Segment the target 
			surface into surface patches that are &quot;simple&quot;-- that is a surface 
			that is geodesically convex and have no holes. A surface is said to be 
			geodesically convex if the shortest curve joining any two points on the 
			surface is a geodesic curve. 2) <b>Start curve selection</b>: 
			We initiate the trajectory generation procedure by laying an initial pass 
			termed the <b>start curve</b> on the surface. The cycle time required 
			for the material deposition process as well as the uniformity of material 
			deposition are critically dependent on the choice of start curve, or more 
			specifically, the orientation of the start curve and its relative position 
			with respect to the surface boundary. 3) <b>Index 
			width optimization</b>: We optimize 
			the spacing between adjacent passes termed the index width to minimize 
			the cycle time subject to the constraint that the resultant material deposition 
			uniformity is within acceptable levels. 4) <b>Speed 
			optimization</b>: the interaction 
			between the material deposition pattern and the surface geometry typically 
			produces non-uniform material deposition on the target surface if the 
			end-effector moves along the coverage path with constant speed. Speed 
			optimization attempts to compensate for the surface curvature related 
			results and improves the uniformity of material deposition in the direction 
			of the passes. </p>
								
			<p>We have developed 
			procedures to solve the problems of start curve selection, index width 
			optimization and speed optimization. The choice of the start curve has 
			impacts the spatial orientation as well as the geodesic curvature of the 
			resultant passes. Recall that the geodesic curvature of a curve measures 
			how much the curve bends sideways within the surface. High geodesic curvature 
			of the start curve typically leads to self-intersections of the resultant 
			offset curves; these self-intersections are undesirable because they have 
			a drastically adverse effect on the resultant uniformity of material deposition. 
			Clearly, to minimize the possibility of self-intersections on the offset 
			curves, the start curve should have minimum geodesic curvature, that is, 
			the start curve should be a geodesic curve. However, the offsets of a 
			geodesic curve on a surface with non-zero Gaussian curvature (a measure 
			of how much a surface bends in two directions at a given point on the 
			surface) are not geodesics. In such cases, the relative position of the 
			start curve with respect to surface boundary determines the geodesic curvature 
			of the offset curves. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem from differential 
			geometry, we determine the optimal relative position of the start curve 
			by finding a curve that splits the given target surface components into 
			two parts such that the integral of Gaussian curvature on each part is 
			the same as the other. We term such a curve as a <b>Gaussian 
			curvature divider</b>. Thus, a start curve that is a geodesic and a 
			Gaussian curvature divider minimizes the geodesic curvature on the offset 
			curves, and equivalently maximizes the uniformity of material deposition. 
			However, there are infinitely many Gaussian curvature dividers on a C^2 
			surface, loosely speaking, at least one for each orientation of the passes. 
			To optimize the cycle time, we will select the orientation of the start 
			curve that minimizes the number of passes and equivalently the cycle time 
			for the coverage path.</p>

			<p>
			Once we have selected the start curve, we focus towards optimizing the 
			end-effector speed along the passes and selecting the spacing between 
			the passes to optimize the uniformity of material deposition on the 
			target surface. Typically, the profiles of material deposition in the 
			direction orthogonal to that of a pass have a relatively consistent 
			structure as we along the pass. Therefore the uniformity of material 
			can be thought of as having two components: one along the direction 
			of the passes, and the second in the direction orthogonal to the passes. 
			On a planar surface, the material deposition profiles have the same 
			structure as we move along the pass, and thus resultant material deposition 
			is uniform in the direction of the passes. However, on curved surfaces, 
			the deposition pattern &quot;warps&quot; according to surface curvature 
			and hence, in general, the material deposition profiles vary in shape 
			and magnitude as we move along a pass. Speed optimization attempts to 
			compensate for these curvature related differences in the deposition 
			profiles and improves uniformity in the direction of the passes. In 
			our speed optimization formulation, we evaluate the uniformity of paint 
			deposition on the entire surface for each updated time profile (equivalently 
			velocity profile) along the path in the quadratic optimization problem. 
			In Figure 3(b), <b>D </b>is the matrix [D(p_i,p_j)] which gives the 
			deposition flux at point p_i when the spray gun is at point p_j along 
			the path. We assume that the path is discretized into linear segments 
			of length l_i, and t_i is the time spent by the spray gun over segment 
			of length l_i. v_max and v_min are the maximum and minimum permissible 
			velocities and a_max is the maximum permissible acceleration and deceleration.<br /></p>
